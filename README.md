# Netflix Dataset Data Visualization
Project Overview
This project aims to visualize and analyze trends, patterns, and insights within Netflix’s streaming content catalog using a dataset of movies and TV shows. The dataset includes information on titles, types, genres, release years, ratings, and more. Through data visualization techniques, we explore various insights such as content distribution over the years, popular genres, and the geographical reach of Netflix's content.

Dataset Information
Source:
The Netflix dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via platforms such as Kaggle. It contains details on the titles available on Netflix as of a specific time.

Features:
The dataset contains the following columns:

show_id: Unique identifier for each title.
type: The category of content (e.g., Movie or TV Show).
title: Name of the show/movie.
director: Name of the director(s).
cast: List of main actors.
country: Country where the show was produced.
date_added: Date when the title was added to Netflix.
release_year: Year when the movie/show was released.
rating: Age group rating of the content (e.g., PG, R, TV-MA).
duration: Duration of the movie or number of seasons for TV shows.
listed_in: Categories or genres of the content.
description: A brief description of the movie or show.
File Format:
The dataset is provided in a CSV format.

Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

Content Trend Analysis: To analyze the addition of content over time and identify trends in content production.
Genre Distribution: To visualize the distribution of various genres and categories available on Netflix.
Country-wise Content: To understand the geographical distribution of content on Netflix.
Content Ratings: To explore the content ratings and understand Netflix's audience focus (e.g., children, teens, adults).
